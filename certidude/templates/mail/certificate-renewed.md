Renewed {{ common_name }} ({{ serial_number }})

This is simply to notify that certificate for {{ common_name }}
was renewed and the serial number of the new certificate is {{ serial_number }}.

The new certificate is valid from {{ certificate.not_valid_before }} until
{{ certificate.not_valid_after }}.

Services making use of those certificates should continue working as expected.
